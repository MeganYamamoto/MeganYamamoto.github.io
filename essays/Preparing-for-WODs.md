In this WOD in a folder called Invoice1, we must create a file called invoice.html that displays a sales receipt for the sale of five different products by using expressions and variables to compute values dynamically. These variables include item name, quantity, price, extended price, subtotal, tax and total. For further details regarding the instructions for WOD Invoice1, please click the following link and refer to Invoice1 found under the Experimental Learning Header.

My experience performing the WOD was acceptable in some respects and needed work in other aspects. What worked well was using JavaScript to declare variables and using expressions to compute values dynamically. To create the table in which the invoice would be displayed, I went with option 1. In the WOD, I was able to successfully copy the HTML format of the table provided in the instructions page by viewing page source and pasting it into the document, however, what slowed me down the most was understanding how to convert static html template into a document.write() and use string templates to fill in the product data in the row cells dynamically.

To prepare for this WOD, I used what I had learned from the corresponding lab in order to get a general understanding of what the WOD might require. Differently from the previous WODs, I felt that from the practice I received from doing the lab that I was confident enough to put my knowledge to the test by going straight into my first attempt. Unfortunately, this did not go over as well as I had hoped as I ran into some issues. I later realized that the problems I ran into could have been avoided If I had been more thorough in my preparation.

For this particular WOD, I found the Introducing Expressions and Operators Screencast to be an essential tool for understanding key concepts needed to complete the tasks. The topics that were most helpful to complete Invoice1 were String Templates and Escape Sequences. To be better prepared for the next WOD, I might try to watch the screen recordings first to make sure that I donâ€™t miss any important information that can used to successfully complete it.
