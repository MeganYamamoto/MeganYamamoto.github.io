<b>1.	Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards) </b>
My system is a store called "My Farmer's Market". It sells various fruits, vegetables, and animal produced products. The fruits that are offered are boxes of pears, apples, lemons, oranges, bananas, and limes. The vegetables that we sell include boxes of lettuce, tomatoes, celery, carrots, cucumbers, and onions. The animal produced products we have are jugs of honey, 3-pack cartons of milk, a wheel of goat cheese, boxes of margarine, boxes of sheep wool, and cases of eggs. The name "My Farmer's Market" came from the idea that these items are locally produced and freshly grown or produced!

<b>2.	Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented? </b>

<br>

<b>3.	Describe what you are most proud of about your system: </b>
I am most proud of the way the overall system looks and flows. I think the navigation bar and user personalization enhances the user experience and helps it to look like something you would see on a real website. A user can log in at any point, but if the user tries to make a purchase- they need to be signed into their account in order to complete the purchase. Once a user logs in, only then will they be able to see a log out button with the user's name or edit account button on the navbar, and finally the home page message will change from "Welcome to Your Farmer's Market" to "Welcome to (user's name)'s Farmers Market". 
<br>

<b>4.	Describe what you are least happy with your system: </b>

<br>

<b>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2? </b>
There were many ways in which Assignment 2 differed from Assignment 3. Some of the major differences include using (cookies) and or sessions for your cart, adding more security features, adding personalization to the website, and emailing the user and invoice once a purchase is complete. In this assignemnt, we had an individual requirement that was assigned to us and required to be implemented into the system. My individual requirement was IR1: "Maintain last product page visited by user. When user leaves and comes back to site, they are taken automatically to the last product page visited. After login or register, they return to the last page visited. After checkout, the last page visited becomes the home page."
